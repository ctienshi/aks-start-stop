# Automation Account

Azure Automation delivers a cloud-based automation and configuration service 
that supports consistent management across your Azure and non-Azure 
environments.

Using this module, you can define an automation account. You can also define 
`credential` and `schedule` for your automation account, if you set the related 
`count` value for them as `True`.

Process automation in Azure Automation allows you to create and manage 
PowerShell runbooks. You can define a runbook within your automation account 
using another module called `automation-runbook`.
